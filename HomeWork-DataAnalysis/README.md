# Sales and Customer Analysis

This repository contains an extensive data analysis project focusing on sales and customer demographic data. The project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization using Python.

## 📂 Project Structure
The repository includes the following files:
- `NewMind_FirstHomework.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing all code and analysis.
- `satis_verisi_5000.csv`: Sales dataset with details of products sold.
- `musteri_verisi_5000_utf8.csv`: Customer dataset with demographic and spending information.
- `Odev-Veri-Analizi.docx`: Instructions for the homework assignment.

## 📝 Analysis Overview
This project covers the following tasks:
1. **Data Cleaning and Manipulation**: Address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the datasets.
2. **Time Series Analysis**: Analyze weekly and monthly sales trends and visualize patterns.
3. **Categorical and Numerical Analysis**:
   - Total sales by product category.
   - Spending behavior based on age groups and gender.
4. **Advanced Data Manipulation**:
   - Spending trends by city.
   - Sales growth rates by product.
5. **Extras (Bonus)**:
   - Pareto Analysis (80/20 rule).
   - Cohort Analysis.
   - Simple regression-based sales prediction.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- The **Electronics** category accounted for nearly half of all sales, dominating total revenue.
- Customers aged **50+** exhibited the highest spending trends across all categories.
- Both genders contributed almost equally to sales, with slight variations across categories.

## 📊 Visualizations
The notebook includes various plots and charts, such as:
- Sales trends over time.
- Bar charts showing total sales by category and gender.
- Pie charts to visualize category-wise sales distribution.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
